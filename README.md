**Binge Thinkers**

**Overview**

Binge Thinkers is a Python-based retail data analysis tool designed to process a CSV file containing sales and revenue data. The script extracts meaningful insights, such as seasonal sales patterns, top-performing products, and revenue trends, and visualizes them to help businesses make informed decisions.

**Requirements**


To use this tool, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. The required Python libraries include pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for for visualizations. Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the script.

**Features**


This tool offers a variety of features for retail sales analysis. It analyzes seasonal sales patterns, identifies top-performing products based on revenue, and visualizes revenue trends over time. Additionally, it can export enriched datasets with added features such as time-based columns (Year, Month, Day, etc.) for future use.

**How to Use**


To use the tool, first clone the repository or download the script. Place your sales data CSV file in the project directory. Ensure the required libraries are installed by running pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn. Launch the script using the command python retail_sales_analysis.py, and follow the prompts to select your input file. Once the analysis is complete, the tool will display visualizations to help you interpret the data.

**CSV File Requirement**


The CSV file should contain the following essential columns:


Date: The date of sales, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

Product: The name of the product.

Revenue: The sales revenue for each transaction.

Quantity : The number of units sold.


The script expects these columns to be present and correctly formatted. Missing or improperly formatted columns may result in errors during analysis.

**Data Preprocessing**


The tool preprocesses your data by converting the Date column into a standard datetime format. It then extracts additional time-based features such as Year, Month, Day, and Weekday. The script also handles missing or invalid data entries gracefully, ensuring accurate analysis and visualization.

**Visualizations**

This tool generates the following visualizations to provide meaningful insights into your retail data:

Seasonal Sales Patterns: A line chart showing monthly revenue trends to help identify high and low sales seasons.

Top 10 Products: A bar chart displaying the top-performing products based on total revenue.

Revenue Trends: A line plot of daily revenue trends to track performance over time.

These visualizations allow you to understand key patterns and trends in your data effectively.


**Output Examples**

The tool generates outputs in two formats:

Visualizations: Clear and informative graphs that highlight trends and insights.

Enriched Data: A CSV file with additional features (e.g., extracted time-based columns) for further analysis.

**Error Handling**

The tool includes robust error handling to ensure smooth operation. It alerts the user if required columns are missing and handles non-numeric or missing values in key fields gracefully. This makes it reliable for a wide range of datasets.

**Future Enhancements**

Planned improvements for this project include:

Adding support for regional sales analysis.

Integrating machine learning models for sales forecasting.

Automating PDF reporting of insights and visualizations for easier sharing and review.
